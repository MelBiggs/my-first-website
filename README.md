# My First Webpage 

*Welcome!*

This project is a stepping stone into the world of code. Each language, software or interface mentioned in this project will be investigated during my course. 

Using HTML5 and CSS3, each item has a link to more information along with its logo.

Included in this project was my introduction to CLI's and I learnt the importance of using Git and GitHub simultaneously to secure code against accidental and malicious loss.
